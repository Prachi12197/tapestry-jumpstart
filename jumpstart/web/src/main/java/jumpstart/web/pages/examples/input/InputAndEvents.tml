	<h3>Input and Events</h3>
	
	So far we have looked at output. We have seen that when a <strong>page render request</strong> reaches 
	the server, Tapestry renders the page to HTML and returns it. And we have seen that one way to 
	send a page render request is to click a link produced by PageLink.<br/><br/>
	
	Now we will look at <strong>input</strong> and <strong>events</strong>.<br/><br/>
	
	Input and events always target a page or a component on a page. The two most common components for 
	this are Form and EventLink. They are shown in the next examples.<br/><br/>

	Input and events are sent to the server as <strong>component event requests</strong>, and they relate 
	to a specific component in a page, eg. a Form or EventLink. Tapestry directs the request to the <em>the page and 
	component class that rendered</em> the page and component in the first place. <strong>This is great!</strong> 
	Who is better placed to understand the purpose of input from a Form or an event from an EventLink 
	than the page that contains that Form or EventLink.<br/><br/>  

	Some other components also send component event requests, such as GridPager. 
	And in fact almost every component can send a component event request when the component is 
	<strong>Ajax</strong>-enabled. We'll look at Ajax later.<br/><br/>
