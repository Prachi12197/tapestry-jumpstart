		<h1>The Layout Component</h1>

		Page 1 and 2 have the same layout: a colored margin, two PageLinks, and this text, around some content.<br/>  
		We did this by writing a component that outputs all of that <em>and the contents of its body</em>.<br/> 
		We called the component <em>Layout</em>, but we could have used any other name. <br/>
		Then we put <em>Layout</em> in both pages, and moved the rest of their contents into <em>Layout's</em> body.<br/> 
		So on display, their contents are inside Layout!<br/><br/>
